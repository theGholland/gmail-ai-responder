# Local LLM Email Tone Coach (Starter)

This repository scaffolds a strictly local workflow: fetch an email thread from your provider (Gmail/Outlook/IMAP), pass the thread and your draft to a locally hosted LLM (Ollama or vLLM), receive a tonal critique plus two rewrites, and optionally create a **native draft** in your mailbox so you can send from your usual client.

## How it works

* **Gmail integration.** `runner.py` authenticates with Google via OAuth, retrieves thread contents and can create reply drafts.
* **Local model interaction.** The assembled prompt (thread, draft, and goal) is sent to a locally hosted model through an OpenAI-compatible endpoint and the model's critique is returned.
* **Web interface.** Flask routes display the latest thread, accept user drafts/goals, and call the model for tone coaching.
* **Security posture.** Designed for localhost-only deployment; start with read-only mail scopes and never commit secrets.

## Quickstart (single‑user, localhost)

1. **Install a local model server.** E.g., with Ollama:

   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3.1
   ollama serve   # or run in the background
   ```

   The default OpenAI‑style endpoint is `http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1`.

2. **Create and activate a Python environment.** Install the pinned dependencies to ensure consistent versions:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Using a virtual environment keeps these pinned packages isolated from your system Python.

3. **Configure environment.** Copy `.env.example` ➜ `.env` and set values. At minimum:

   * `LLM_BASE_URL` (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1`)
   * `LLM_MODEL` (e.g., `llama3.1` or `qwen2.5:14b-instruct`)

4. **Gmail or Microsoft Graph auth (optional at first).**

  * For Gmail, place your `credentials.json` (OAuth client) next to your runner script. On first run the script logs an authorization URL instead of opening a browser; copy the link into a browser, authorize the app, and paste the returned code back into the terminal. Use scope `gmail.readonly` until you enable draft creation.
   * For Outlook/Microsoft 365, register an app in Azure AD and set `AZURE_APP_CLIENT_ID` (device‑code flow is simplest during development).

5. **Run your app.** The starter assumes a Flask app binding to `127.0.0.1:7860`. Visit that URL to fetch a thread, paste a draft, and call the local LLM.

### Creating Gmail `credentials.json`

1. Open [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create or select a project.
2. Enable the **Gmail API** from *APIs & Services → Library*.
3. Configure the **OAuth consent screen** (External user type is sufficient for personal/testing use) and add your Gmail address as a test user.
4. Go to *APIs & Services → Credentials*, click **+ Create Credentials → OAuth client ID**, and choose **Desktop app**.
5. Download the resulting JSON file and rename it to `credentials.json`.
6. Place `credentials.json` next to `runner.py`; the first run will output a URL. Visit it in a browser, approve access, and paste the resulting code into the console to store a token locally.

> The JSON file and generated tokens contain secrets—keep them out of version control.

## Security model

* Keep the LLM server and the Flask app bound to **loopback only** (`127.0.0.1`).
* Begin with **read‑only** mail scopes; add draft‑creation scopes after you trust the flow.
* Never commit secrets: `.env`, OAuth tokens, and `credentials.json` are already ignored by `.gitignore`.

## Extending

* Add a minimal browser extension that passes the current thread/conversation ID to `http://127.0.0.1:7860/open?conv=<ID>`.
* Add a second provider module using Microsoft Graph; the interface is parallel to Gmail: fetch conversation by `conversationId`, then create a draft reply.
